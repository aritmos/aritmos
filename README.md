<h2> Hi I'm Seb! <img align="right" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/j0ph697YBTGM8zm3u8/giphy.gif" width="50"> </h2>

- 👨‍🎓 I am a Mathematical Physics graduate who is also very interested in computers.
- ⏲️ I enjoy focusing on performance-oriented implementations; a great contrast from my code golf past.
- 🦀 I'm an average Rust lang enjoyer.
- 🏢 While I have mostly only ever coded as a hobby in the past couple years, I hope to continue learning until I am competent enough to possibly persue a career in the field.

```rust
impl AboutMeCode {
    #[inline(never)]
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            setup:     vec!["Windows", "Ubuntu (WSL)", "Neovim"],
            ci_cd:     vec!["Markdown", "Git", "Github"],
            knowledge: vec!["Mathematics", "Theoretical Physics", "Computer Science"],
            langs:     vec!["Python", "Rust"],  // Some Julia and C++ too               // WIP
            databases: todo!()                                                          // WIP
        }
    }
}
```

- Have recently taken to solving Leetcode and [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) challenges in my spare time:
